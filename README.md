# codewars-solutions

My solutions for Codewars katas, written using Python 3.6+.

Rankings explained (from Codewars): 
> Ranks are used to indicate progression and difficulty. Code Warriors complete Kata which are assigned a rank, which in turn earns them a higher rank once they complete enough of them... You begin with Kyu at level 8 and work your way down to level 1.
